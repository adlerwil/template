			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>There are many possible solutions, but I believe raising the fines to millions of dollars and donating that to charity will show great results. Money is one thing NFL player’s care about more than anything, and also why they work so hard. When a player such as Nick Fairley sees his teammate lose 6 million dollars for a DUI charge, he might call a taxi next time he is drunk and needs to get home from the bar. Also, suspending players for entire seasons at a time automatically, should show drastic changes for this issue. Professional football players all have a certain pride for their team. In some cases, winning the super bowl or going to the playoffs is much more important that the money they earn. If a crucial asset to a team gets arrested, and suspended for a whole season/playoffs, the player is doing a disservice to his team, and negatively affecting the outcome of their season. The coach and all teammates will be very unhappy. The great thing about this system is that the players have nobody to blame except for themselves if they get in trouble, and have a long time to reflect on what they did wrong, and should make them change their ways, or at least be more careful. This issue will be much more under control, and will show when you turn on sport center every morning, and DON’T see news about another football player getting arrested. These players will be setting a much better example for young football players, and maybe even a good example for celebrities in other categories. </p>
