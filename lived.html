		<h1>Moment Of Truth</h1>
		<p>One cold winter day, in 2013, I came home to my house to find a letter from Michigan State University. It was a letter confirming my acceptance, and I can assure you that this was one of the proudest moments of my life. Gifted with this great opportunity, picking my major, and a career for my future was the next big topic. I have always been interested in the criminal justice field, but with many subfields to that, I had to narrow it down. I did not want to be a lawyer, because I was not enthusiastic about being in a courtroom setting. I thought I might want to be a probation officer, but I wanted something with a little bit more adventure and importance. I realized that throughout my lifetime, my mind has always been troubled when I could not decide whether or not an acquaintance of mine was telling the truth, or if they were lying straight to my face. There are always clues to believe somebody is lying, whether it is a change in pitch of the voice, cracking the knuckles, sweating, or other various examples. I was about 13 years old when I first watched the game show titled “The Moment Of Truth”, which opened my mind up to impressive technology that could be highly sufficient in detecting whether or not a person is lying, or telling the truth. This incredible instrument is the polygraph, (or lie detector). This would go very well with a criminal justice. After being fascinated with this technology, I chose to make my goal to become a police detective/investigator, and in this field I would get to work with polygraphs. </p>
		<p>In this game show “Moment Of Truth” hosted by Mark Wahlberg, the contestants would go in front of a live audience, and answer questions about themselves. If the answers the contestants gave matched up with the polygraph’s results, they would win increasingly larger amounts of money with each question. If the contestant chooses to answer all 21 of these questions correctly, they win a grand prize of 500000$. With each question getting more and more personal, the contestants may lie or choose not to answer a question, and leave with under 25,000$. This was by far the most entertaining part of the show, and I remember I would be dying of laughter depending on how personal the questions were. I really was fascinated by this technology, I thought “How could that machine read those people’s mind, and prove that they were lying”? I wanted to get a polygraph myself, but I was young and didn’t realize how expensive this equipment was. This is what introduced me to the polygraph, and influenced my choice to later strive to get a degree in criminal justice. </p>
		<p>The polygraph is an incredible piece of technology, and can serve many other purposes than just a game show on television. The polygraph was developed by John Larson, a police officer and medical student in Berkley, California, and now we have been using it for almost 100 years. Many police officers and other professions require employees to take a polygraph when they are doing background checks. Almost all government positions require a polygraph to be sure they don’t have a dirty record or bad intentions. This is a sure way to get the most accurate background checks on their employees, if they are missing information on paper about them. The polygraph seemed most appealing to me when I saw it used on Crime Scene Investigation TV shows. It is very useful in the field of criminal justice. If investigators feel it is necessary, they will use the polygraph to directly ask a criminal about the act involved. It seemed so cool to me to be the one in the isolated room asking a criminal “where were you on the night of January 7th”. Being educated in reading and interpreting a polygraph, I would be able to tell right away if the criminal is lying, and force him into a confession after multiple trials. There is a lot of other high technology that is used in the field of criminal justice, but I am most interested by the polygraph I would be very happy investigating crimes for my future career, and taking advantage of using the polygraph whenever it is necessary. </p>
		<p>Much like most of the technology today, Larson’s polygraph was very complex. When someone undergoes a polygraph test, 4 to 6 sensors are attached to the person, each serving its own purposes. A few questions are asked like name, and other definite truths, or lies, just to see if the lie detector is in sync. I could have some fun with this and make up humorous questions while I’m questioning criminals. The polygraph uses its advanced technology to measure the person’s pulse, blood pressure, breathing rate, and how much they are perspiring. Sometimes they will even record things such as slight arm, leg, or body movements. The polygraph is recording all of its results on paper, and also can be read via computer screen. The more educated a polygraph examiner is, the more accurate the results can be read. Although these results cannot always be one hundred percent true, I will study hard to master reading a polygraph, so I can be an expert when investigating crimes. One thing I found amusing with polygraphs was that there are ways people can try to mislead them, and confuse it. One of the ways to do this is find out what you are going to be asked, and practice answering it false, with extremely normal reactions. I think it would also be really cool to have one of my colleagues run lie detector tests on me, to see if I could lie and see how accurate it is to professionals. This way I might be able to notice if a suspect is trying to beat the test, and give him a harder test with reworded questions, and a different environment.</p>
		<p>Because of my interest in the investigation and justice process, I figured I would love to spend my life interrogating suspects, and using the best technology throughout the process. The polygraph is a fascinating instrument, and with enough studying and hard work at this wonderful university, I will be skilled enough one day to operate one myself. I feel like this would be a thrilling life, working with criminals, and I would definitely be impacting society in a positive way. It would also be awesome if I could run polygraphs on government officials. I would get to meet a lot of important figures, and would actually be doing something useful for my country. “Moment Of Truth” was where I was first introduced to how this instrument worked, and although it was just a television show, the results and procedures for the lie detector tests are very real. I am driven to work my hardest, and when I graduate this university I will have a degree in criminal justice, and hopefully am on my way to important investigations requiring me to use a polygraph. My mind is made, and for now, all I have to do is study hard, and keep my best interests in mind.
