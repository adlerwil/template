			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The issue at hand is the complete disregard of violation of the law by NFL players, and that they continue to live these wild lifestyles off the field, and the poor example being set for young athletes in across the world. It was not even two months later that Fairley would find himself in even more trouble than before. On May 27th, 2012, Fairley was arrested again in his hometown of Mobile Alabama, for driving under the influence and attempting to elude police. This time Fairley received 3 more tickets: reckless driving, having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle and no proof of insurance. This particular arrest exploded on the media, because it looked just as bad as it was. Fairley was said to be going 100 miles per hour, refused to pull over for a state trooper, then was recorded at a .18 BAC(blood alcohol content), with open alcohol in the car! It had not even been 60 days, and Fairley was already back on the media, but for all the wrong reasons. This second offense proved to me that Fairley did not change his ways of partying after his first arrest, and shows no remorse for his actions. These professional athletes feel that they have enough money to do whatever they please, with a lack of judgment on what is right. Fairley basically paid his way out of both of the arrests, something that many of us are not fortunate to be able to do. This is getting out of control, and ruining the image for professional football players across America, and rightfully so.  With many young athletes idolizing players such as Nick Fairley, something must be done to stop all these scandals</p>
