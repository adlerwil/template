			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>Much of America would agree with me in saying that these NFL players getting charged with every arrest, from drugs to murder, is a big issue. These players flaunt their money, and use it to party in the offseason. They have a complete disregard for lawful authority, and it is almost as if these players believe they can do anything, due to their persona, and amount of money. The rules still apply to these players, whether or not they believe it, and something must be done. It is unacceptable that Nick Fairley was charged with drug possession, let off the hook, and again was charged with a DUI, and three other tickets. The NFL must reinforce much stricter disciplinary actions to keep these players under control. They should be role models for young athletes across America, because these men are the best. Something needs to be done, and it needs to happen as soon as possible before chaos erupts across the NFL. It is only a matter of time before a player makes a tragic mistake, and the impact is devastating to our country.</p>
