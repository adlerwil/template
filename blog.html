		<p>I believe the purpose of this video was to show us a different type of writing: in a letter, reflecting personal experience. Another purpose of this video could have been to show the dangers of prejudiced towards gay people. It shows us the consequences, and how passionate some people are about their feelings. In a way, it was a suicide awareness video. This was done by first showing us in writing the point the author is trying to make. Then he talks about his experience on camera, and this shows us the emotion and passionin the authors voice. He is giving us a brief history of his life, so we can understood what he went through in a chronological order. The structure of this was to introduce us to actual pages from the book in writing, so we got an idea of the topic. Then the camera was focused on Randy, and he summarized his story. Then he stopped explaining it, and told us too read more it gets better. He basically leaves us with a cliffhanger. After seeing this. I may make some changes to the structure of my lived experiences paper. I might focues more time on the history of my technology, and make sure it is properly introduced. This should make it more interesting, and less cluttered if i make a better introduction paragraph.  </p>
		<h1>In class activity 2</h1>
		<p>The group of people targeted in this episode of South Park was lazy people, who take videogames extremely seriously, and think of them as a way of life. I refer to these people as gamers. These people spend a good portion of their day sitting in a chair, and on the computer, or other types of gaming systems. Avid gamers are generally young teenagers, but they can range from any age, even to grown men. The social issues represented by this video is that these gamers are very lazy. This makes them not as productive, and as a whole, make our country less productive. Another social issue is that while they are obsessing over a videogame, they spend much of their day in a fantasy world, shielded from the real problems they should be facing in their everyday life. If many young teenagers are living in a fantasy world, and ignoring the real world, this does not show well for our future of America. The writers for South Park portray this laziness social issue by making the kids gain excessive weight in the weeks spend playing World of Warcraft. They also develop terrible acne, which shows that gamers are becoming unhealthy, and do not care very much about their appearance. Although South Park is sarcastic in all their humor, they were very on point with this social issue. Even when the kids were done conquering the game at the end, they continue to go back in the game even though they already won. This shows that they are consuming all of their time into this game, and shielding themselves from reality. The only challenges they were facing was in the videogame, and had no contact with anyone in the outside world, except over a computer of course. I think that the writers of South Park are geniuses, and did a wonderful job ridiculing these “gamers”. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 3</h1>
		<p>It was a very long weekend for me, when I went to visit my girlfriend at Central Michigan University. I was supposed to leave Sunday morning, but I overslept and missed my ride back to State. I then bought a bus ticket to leave Mt Pleasant and head back to State at 4:55 p.m The only problem with this is I knew I would miss our class on monday, and this freaked me out because we usually have classwork that is due in class, and I didn't have anyone's phone number to call for my missing work. I looked online, and it said that we had an activity due in the dropbox at the end of the day. I got back late Monday night, went to our professor's office hours, and she told me exactly what I needed to make up from Monday's class. I submitted it to the dropbox on Tuesday when i got back, and my grade only suffered 10%. I dodged a bullet there, and this was the only class I missed all semester. The key to this writing class is to go to every single class, so you recieve proper instructions from the professor for every project.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 4</h1>
		<p>It is very hard to do a project designed for a group all by yourself. Me and my partner Aaron planned for weeks that we would film on the Sunday after the Hardwell concert. I woke up to a text Sunday morning from Aaron's roomate, saying that Aaron is in the hospital for an unknown drug given to him at the concert. Aaron was in a very serious condition, and was unable to leave the hospital until Tuesday. His roomate asked me if i could do all the filming and editing for the documentary on my own. Me and Aaron agreed to do this as a team, and I felt it would be too challenging to try and compose the whole documentary myself. I lack the technological skill to complete such a task. I decided to email our professor, and ask for extended time to film the project, since it was due Monday( the next day). I asked Aaron to email her as well, so there was no confusion about the situation. Professor Daniels was sympathetic, and as long as Aaron provided a doctor's note, she would allow the project to be due on Thursday. Aaron was released from the hospital, and we started fimling on Wednesday, finishing the project by Thursday. This was definately a nerve wrecking experience for me, thinking i would have to do the whole project on my own. I am glad we got extended time, and Aaron is feeling better.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 5</h1>
		<p>Now that the Multimodal Remix project is over, I can finally relax and not be stressed out. Making my own documentary was by far the most entertaining project we have done all year. Instead of writing a boring 3,000 word paper, we were able to be creative and put something into film that we felt passionate about. It was fun to get out of the classroom, and have the freedom to use a video camera and other technologies. This was my first time filming anything on a camera, and I enjoyed it very much. Our documentary was about the prices of textbooks being too high, and we filmed all around campus. Me and my partner went to multiple bookstores to collect footage, and we even went inside one and re-enacted a situation where a student would ask the manager for a textbook, and would be overcharged. Even the store manager at Collegeville Textbook Co. seemed to have a good time while he was being filmed, and enjoyed the idea of our documentary. I got to be the sole actor in our documentary, and I like to believe I did a really good job. If I could be filmed again i would have looked up at the camera more, and articulated my words more. The funniest part of our documentary was when I interviewed a few kids outside Hubbard smoking cigarettes, they decided to use a lot of profanity. I did not fully support it, but it was improvised and we had to keep filming. I did not cut it out of the documentary, even when F bombs were dropped, because documentaries should include real footage that is not staged. Documentaries are awesome.  </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 6</h1>
		<p>Today, I was very pleased when one of my classmates informed me that there would be no final exam for this class. I have written exams in all my other classes, and this should make finals week alot easier. I have not been doing much of the Codecademy workshop, nor did i buy any books in this class, so a written final exam would have been very difficult for me. The only assignment during finals week was a paper, reflecting our year in WRA 110. I knew i could write a good paper, because it is all a reflection of our personal experiences. I learned a lot in this course about my writing abilities, and definately do not mind writing this oppose to taking an exam. I think most of the class would agree with me on this one. Now the only other aspect I will have to worry about during finals week is finishing up this blog, and making sure my website is proper and complete. Thank you Professor Daniels for not assigning us a final exam during finals week. Your mercy is appreciated. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 7</h1>
		<p>In this blog entry, I will talk about my biggest regret in this course. For a reason that can only be justified by laziness, I did not submit a Formal Research Essay. In fact, I did not even write a rough draft. I completely blew off this assignment, because I viewed it as too challenging. I did not trust my abilities to write a fantastic paper, and sold myself short. This essay ended up being fifteen percent of our total grade, meaning the maximum grade I could now earn is an 85 percent. I procrastinated way too long, then decided it would be easier to not attempt a paper at all, knowing it would hurt my grade. If I could go back in time, I would have started working on this paper immediately, and trusted my abilities to write a challenging paper. I feel like if I would have submitted this paper, I could have recieved a grade of a 4.0 in the class. My mom will not be happy to find out why my writing grade is so poor. I have no explanation for her other than that i was lazy, and did not care enough. Now I have been working super hard just to pass the class, with my grade falling.   </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 8</h1>
		<p>Today, I will share why writing is my least favorite class. Ever since middle school, i have been a mediocre writer at best. I always think of good ideas and topics to write about, with a lot of supporting detail. My problem is getting the ideas out of my head and onto paper. Whenever I write, I can not get the proper words to explain what I am saying. Sometimes the words do not completely make sense in the context they are in, and this makes my papers sound worse. I also have a tendency to have run on sentences, because I do not know how to properly end a sentence sometimes. This has put a lot of stress on my over the years, considering almost every class in High School requires a paper to be written at some point. I would have not even signed up for this course if it was not required to take one WRA class. Imagine my joy when I realized I had to take a whole class on writing papers (sarcasm). Sometimes in life, you must do things that you do not want to do, and for me, taking this course is one of them. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 9</h1>
		<p>As I am sitting in class right now, I am very distracted because I look outside, and it is a beautiful day. The sun in finally shining, it's about 65 degrees, and people all around campus are wearing shorts, skirts, and tank tops. I walked to class instead of taking the bus, and i stopped at the food truck and got my combo exchange. The food truck is always outside Bessey at this time, but I usually eat at my dorms before I leave. The cheeseburger was delicious, and it was a perfect way to satisfy my hunger before class. We are working on our final retrospective project, after I write this entry I will be starting my rough draft. </p>
		<h1>Blog Entry 10</h1>
		<p>For our final course retrospective project, I decided to not choose the web design team, and the writing team I would join would be cultural analysis. I feel that I was more passionate about this poject than any of the others, so it would be easiest to contribute to the website. I am not very educated in technology on the web, and have not done any of the Codeacademy. This is why I chose to not be a part of the web design team, because I would have not known what to do. I really hope that my web design team for cultural analysis puts together a really good website, highlighting each of our individual contributions. Thirty percent of my grade for this project depends on the Web design team, somethiing I have little control over, and this is why I am nervous. I can only hope for the best. </p>
		<h1>Blog entry 11</h1>
		<p>I am writing this blog post at three in the morning, because I have been studying for finals all night. I remembered that we need fifteen blog posts by the end of the course, so i might as well blog whenever it pops up in my head. After I write this I will probably go to sleep, but first I will share some of my thoughts on this course. I am legitemately scared for my final grade, since I did not submit a formal research project. This will also hurt me on the website portion of my grade, where there is no page for the research project. I really need to get as much credit as possible in the last week of this course. I need a 4.0 on my final course retrospective project, my portfolio, and my blog in order to pass the class for sure. I will probably recieve a grade of 2.0, or 2.5 if I am lucky. With my other classes, this will bring it down some, but honestly my grades are not too hot this semeter, and are dropping my cumulartive GPA down a few points. Luckily for me, if I pass this class and get credit, I shouldnt have to take another WRA course for the rest of my college career. </p>
		<h1>Blog entry 12</h1>
		<p>I am still not tired enough to go to sleep, so while I am up, I might as well post another entry. I would like to talk about my favorite class period for WRA 110 this year. One of my favorite shows, if not my favorite show of all time is South Park. I was filled with joy when I walked into class late one day, rushing to my seat to find out what the assignment was, and I heard Cartman's voice on the projector. We were watching one of my favorite episodes, World Of Warcraft, and asked to blog about it. I thought it was funny that South Park was relevant to our course, and that this relationship was clear. I have never watched a Television show I liked that much in any classes, even in High School. It was nice for a change to be able to complete an in class assignment that I was an expert about, and was entertained while writing it. It is class periods like this that make me hope that classes in college do not suck as much as you may think. </p>
		<h1>Blog entry 13</h1>
		<p>One event that happened this semester in class that I never got the chance to blog about was the lock in. I thought it was humorous that everybody was panicking, because i went through this many times in High school, and did not expect it to happen in College. When the door wouldn't lock, everybody started to panic, especially the females. I knew if I just remained calm, the lockdown would be over soon enough. After we got the text notifying us that it was a false alarm, and just an ROTC student with a training gun, everybody seemed relieved, and started to leave. I viewed the whole experience as entertaining, because it was a false alarm to beghin with. In scary situations, people panicking is contagious throughtout the classroom. </p>
		<h1>blog entry 14</h1>
		<p>Honestly, I have enjoyed having a blog this semester. I can voice my own opinions without any judgement, and it helps me reflect on the class. When this course is over, I may want to open my own blog, when I have something worthy of blogging. I like the idea of blogs, and I think that everyone should have a blog on a subject they care about. People think you have to be scholarly to have a blog with a valid opinion, but the truth is that anybody with an opinion can make a blog. Even if it is a blog for humor or a joke, it is still worth having. when i get home, I will show my parents my blog, and they will think that it is very exciting. This is just another benefit of taking this course. </p>
		<h1>blog entry 15</h1>
	<p>This is the last entry I will have for this blog. It is the night that our final work is due in the dropbox for this course, and I have submitted my portfolio, my final project, and my blog link. I have two exams in the morning so I am going to make this blog post a short one. I would encourage students to take this course, because it introduces new challenges and varies from normal WRA courses. It incorporates the importance of technology in the professional world, which is an interesting subject. I wish I recieved a better grade in this course, looking back on it, this course seemed fairly easy. My grade does not reflect what i've truly learned from this course, and that dissapoints me, I hope to recieve a 4.0 on my final project, and that should improve my grade. This is the last time I will have to worry about a WRA assignment, and I am just glad it is over. Next time I hear the word WRA will most likely be in the context of "Billy why was your grade so low in WRA" coming of course from my mother. It was an eventful year, but I am happy it is coming to an end. </p>
