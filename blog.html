		<p>I believe the purpose of this video was to show us a different type of writing: in a letter, reflecting personal experience. Another purpose of this video could have been to show the dangers of prejudiced towards gay people. It shows us the consequences, and how passionate some people are about their feelings. In a way, it was a suicide awareness video. This was done by first showing us in writing the point the author is trying to make. Then he talks about his experience on camera, and this shows us the emotion and passionin the authors voice. He is giving us a brief history of his life, so we can understood what he went through in a chronological order. The structure of this was to introduce us to actual pages from the book in writing, so we got an idea of the topic. Then the camera was focused on Randy, and he summarized his story. Then he stopped explaining it, and told us too read more it gets better. He basically leaves us with a cliffhanger. After seeing this. I may make some changes to the structure of my lived experiences paper. I might focues more time on the history of my technology, and make sure it is properly introduced. This should make it more interesting, and less cluttered if i make a better introduction paragraph.  </p>
