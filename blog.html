		<p>I believe the purpose of this video was to show us a different type of writing: in a letter, reflecting personal experience. Another purpose of this video could have been to show the dangers of prejudiced towards gay people. It shows us the consequences, and how passionate some people are about their feelings. In a way, it was a suicide awareness video. This was done by first showing us in writing the point the author is trying to make. Then he talks about his experience on camera, and this shows us the emotion and passionin the authors voice. He is giving us a brief history of his life, so we can understood what he went through in a chronological order. The structure of this was to introduce us to actual pages from the book in writing, so we got an idea of the topic. Then the camera was focused on Randy, and he summarized his story. Then he stopped explaining it, and told us too read more it gets better. He basically leaves us with a cliffhanger. After seeing this. I may make some changes to the structure of my lived experiences paper. I might focues more time on the history of my technology, and make sure it is properly introduced. This should make it more interesting, and less cluttered if i make a better introduction paragraph.  </p>

		<p>The group of people targeted in this episode of South Park was lazy people, who take videogames extremely seriously, and think of them as a way of life. I refer to these people as gamers. These people spend a good portion of their day sitting in a chair, and on the computer, or other types of gaming systems. Avid gamers are generally young teenagers, but they can range from any age, even to grown men. The social issues represented by this video is that these gamers are very lazy. This makes them not as productive, and as a whole, make our country less productive. Another social issue is that while they are obsessing over a videogame, they spend much of their day in a fantasy world, shielded from the real problems they should be facing in their everyday life. If many young teenagers are living in a fantasy world, and ignoring the real world, this does not show well for our future of America. The writers for South Park portray this laziness social issue by making the kids gain excessive weight in the weeks spend playing World of Warcraft. They also develop terrible acne, which shows that gamers are becoming unhealthy, and do not care very much about their appearance. Although South Park is sarcastic in all their humor, they were very on point with this social issue. Even when the kids were done conquering the game at the end, they continue to go back in the game even though they already won. This shows that they are consuming all of their time into this game, and shielding themselves from reality. The only challenges they were facing was in the videogame, and had no contact with anyone in the outside world, except over a computer of course. I think that the writers of South Park are geniuses, and did a wonderful job ridiculing these “gamers”. </p>
