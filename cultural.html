			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The reason this report was written was to tie a social issue to a modern artifact of popular culture. The social artifact I chose was the National Football league. The NFL is tied to the social issue of rich individuals flaunting their money and being held unaccountable for their actions, all the while setting a poor example of what successful athletes should be doing. Many NFL players have countless arrests from actions ranging anywhere from DUIâ€™s, to murders. These individuals are never held accountable for their actions simply for their popularity and wealthy status. Proposed solutions for this social issue would be for the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell, to substantially increase the punishments and have proper disciplinary actions for arrests and poor actions. These acts would discourage the players from making these poor decisions on and off of the field. </p>
