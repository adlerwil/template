		<h1>Memo</h1>
		<p>My group and I wanted to compose a documentary that appealed to us directly, and something that was a social issue among college students. We wanted to pick something that was made for the students, to expose something costing them, and ridicule a rival group.  Through making this video, I learned about the severity of the profit the bookstores are making off the students at Michigan State University, by seeing the online prices amazon offered for similar books, and how the bookstores buy back their books to ensure maximum profit.  We encountered a few slight problems while composing our documentary, but they were little problems such as bookstore hours closing.  We had to record scenes at the bookstore, and narrate footage around local bookstores.  Our group composed a video relating to the audience in a positive way, to make them realize how this issue is hurting them directly, and how to avoid it.</p>
		<p>We selected this topic because my friend Aaron has been wanting to expose this for a while, being a senior at Michigan State and buying books for years. The most challenging part of the project was trying to get the group together to record our footage, and editing it so we could prove our point.  The only research method we chose to do was use amazon too compare with the prices of textbooks also sold at Collegeville, and it proved to be very beneficial and help us demonstrate our point.  The biggest struggle was the collaboration aspect of this project. One of our partners did not show up to one class, and did not contact us at all. Another member was only in class for the last one, leaving only me and Aaron to write the whole documentary. Our chosen day to film was a Sunday in late march, but we were not able to record because Aaron was in the hospital on bed rest for the whole weekend. Because of this, we had to film on another date and submit our project late. Because of this, working in groups for the project was not fruitful for me, and I would have almost done better off on a smaller project by myself. I am only happy we pulled it all together in the last week to make a decent video. </p>
		<p>The planning for this project was more of an improvising. We were not very efficient, and procrastinated heavily.  We made our project proposal, then did not work on the making of the project until weeks after.  If I could do this project over again, I would’ve assigned work for every member, and been more efficient with our time.</p>
		<p>The most effective aspect of our documentary was the satire of making the owner of Collegeville textbook company look rude and unpleasant, and that was improvising. It was a real life encounter with the owner, and helped students realize the point we were trying to make with the documentary.  The narration at the beginning of the video helped suck the audience’s attention, appealing to our audience. This was the first time I ever filmed a video, and it was a learning experience for me, and I am glad I got to do this now.</p>
