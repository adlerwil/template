			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The particular arrest that shook me the most and opened my eyes to the issue was On May 27, 2012, when Detroit lion’s defensive powerhouse Nick Fairley was arrested by Alabama State Troopers for driving under the influence and attempting to elude police. Fairley also received a ticket for for reckless driving, having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle, and having no proof of insurance. This shows the severity of the issue at hand, that NFL players feel like they can do whatever they want off the field, and have no remorse for violation of the law. It is as if these players believe that they are superior to the average citizens, and that the money they have proven this to be true. The problems that these men find themselves in are only a result of their actions, and they are not receiving proper punishment.</p>
			<p>Nick Fairley signed a for year contract with the Detroit Lions in 2011, worth 10 million dollars, plus a 5.7 million dollar signing bonus. Fairley, being 6’4 and 291 pounds, was an explosive player to watch on the field, with a lot of young talent and energy. He was known to be a very hard working and disciplined player on the field, and he soon became one of my favorite players on the Detroit lions. I continued to be a Fairley fan, until I found out about all his problems off the field. It was not long until he, like many of his NFL comrades, was charged with his first arrest for possession of marijuana April 3rd, 2012. There was a small amount of marijuana in his possession, and Fairley was released on a 1,000$ bail. This is an extremely small fraction of his 10 million dollar contract, and is equivalent to the average citizens paying a couple of pennies for their bail. The charges were dropped after Fairley passed a drug test in court, which shows that he got let off very easy, with the money to afford proper lawyering to have minimal damage for his actions. As unfair as I thought this was, due to the fact that a normal citizen who does not play professional football would likely be on probation, or facing jail time, I hoped Fairley would learn his lesson, and live above the law for the remainder of his NFL career. </p>
