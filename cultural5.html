			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>I believe that something MUST be done to discipline these players, and that it must happen as soon as possible. Roger Goodell, the commisioner of the National Football league must be the person to step up and fix this problem. I believe he must make a list of every charge that NFL Players have been arrested for in recent years, and applying a much stricter disciplinary ruling for each offense. Since most professional football players are millionaires, they can afford incredible lawyering, and can easily afford any fines that the court charges them with. The charges from Roger Goodell, who is indirectly their employer, should have a much bigger impact on the players than the courts, since football is their passion. I believe harsh suspensions should be placed specifically for drug charges, DUI’s, and gun charges, because these are the most common charges for NFL players across the country. If a player gets arrested for one of these charges, during the season, he should immediately be suspended for the remainder of the season, with disciplinary actions pending on to the next season. If they will automatically be suspended for the season, and the entirety of the playoffs, with disciplinary actions pending for the next season these players might make a point to themselves to at least limit the partying to the offseason, when their primary focus at hand is not their jobs. If they are suspended during the offseason, I believe they should not be allowed near any practice field for the whole offseason, and be suspended for at LEAST the first half of the season. With their careers on the line, these players should think before they act on, and off the field.</p>
			<p>Another solution that would help solve the issue at hand is making these players donate to charity. When these players get themselves into an arrest turning into a scandal, they are usually fined a small amount by the NFL, such as a few thousand dollars. These players are making money every second they are on the field, and most have more than they can spend. Roger Goodell should drastically increase the fines for these players, to an actual amount that would be significant to someone so rich. They should then donate this money to charities across America, so that somebody in need will benefit off of the mistakes made by players. With fines exceeding one million dollars for an arrest, it would affect the professional football players in a much greater way that a small number such as 5000$. Something must be done to discipline these players, so that they do their jobs and we don’t hear about countless arrests off the field, giving the public negative opinions on these people.</p>
