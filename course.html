			<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
			<p>Before I enrolled in this WRA course at Michigan State University, I was at best a mediocre writer. This course was very challenging for me, but I learned quite a bit throughout the year, and I feel this has strongly improved my writing skills, and opened my eyes up to the role writing will play in the professional world. From the first project (Lived experiences) until the last project (documentary remix), I was constantly learning, and working very hard to improve my skills. This course is challenging, and you must have an open and creative mind to do well. The topic of this course is writing: science and technology, and ties together how writing and technology work to help people in their desired field of profession. It taught me a lot about how technology is used in the criminal justice field, and how communication is achieved throughout the field, through writing. We had four projects in this course, all differing from each other and highlighting different aspects of writing. The part that I enjoyed about this class was that a blog was also required, and I had a lot of fun making my own blog, and adding my entries every week or so. We also had to create our own website, where we submitted the link to all our papers and projects. This was the first time I created my own website, and it was challenging to me, but I still got help and had it up and running by the final project. The blog is a small part of the final grade, similar to the classwork grade we receive. Having my own blog was a new and exciting experience.</p>
			<p>The first project we were assigned in this class was the lived experiences project. This asked us to give a small autobiography about our lives, and introduced us to the course. The other part was to pick a field of profession, and write about a piece of technology, and its role in the field. I chose a polygraph (lie detector test) for the field of criminal justice. This was my favorite project because it seemed personal. We added a small autobiography about our lives, and were able to write about a topic we were very interested in. I was able to do research on this polygraph, and learned tons of new information about this piece of technology. I received a 3.5 on my paper, and I was satisfied with my grade, but would’ve preferred a 4.0. I believe I could have focused more of my paper on the functions and characteristics of the polygraph, but instead focused a lot of my paper on how I was introduced to a lie detector test, on a TV show when I was growing up. My conclusion was also rushed, and too short. It was only a few sentences, and I believe if I would have focused more on the polygraph itself, and wrote a stronger conclusion I could’ve received a 4.0 on this paper. My sentence structure was very strong, as well as my spelling, grammar, and structure of the paper. I suggest future writers in this course think very hard about this project, and choose a piece of technology that interests them intensely.</p>
			<p>The second project assigned to us in this course was the cultural analysis project. This is another project that was an individual assignment, 1500 words in length, and needed a draft to be submitted a week before the project was due. This paper was different than the last, and asked us to pick an example of popular culture, and describe how that example described a social issue for a group of people. This is another paper I enjoyed writing very much, because the example I picked was Nick Fairley, a player in the National Football League, and how he describes this issue that NFL players are getting arrested for various crimes, not being disciplined enough, and setting a bad example for young athletes across America. My opinion was very intense in this paper, and it was apparent I took a clear stand in saying that these players are making themselves look horrible, idiotic, ungrateful, non-remorseful, and most importantly setting a bad example. My social issue was clear, and I provided sufficient evidence to back up my opinion. I also suggested clear examples about how the NFL can fix this issue, and how the results will show improvement. Because I hit every single aspect of this paper that was assigned, I received a grade of a 4.0. I was very satisfied with this, because I felt very strongly about this topic, and knew what I was writing about. In order to write a cultural analysis achieving its full potential, you must first educate yourself on the issue you are writing bout.  This was definitely my second favorite project of the year.</p>
			<p>The third project assigned to us was the formal research project. We were supposed to write a paper about communication in the field of criminal justice(or any major) and conduct interviews, show picture evidence, ex. Graphs, charts to support our research. Unfortunately I procrastinated this project until the final weekend, then realized it was too late to set up interview times and do my research, and didn’t submit a paper. This is my biggest regret throughout this course, and my grade is suffering for it. The paper looked more intimidating then it actually was, and I should’ve at least written a rough draft. I could’ve gotten help from the professor and writing center, but instead decided to be lazy and do nothing at all. I suggest nobody taking this course in the future decides to make the same decision I did, because your grade will suffer strongly, and you will not be satisfied with your decision. If I could go back in time, I would’ve definitely tried my best to write this paper, and probably would’ve received a decent grade.</p>
			<p>The fourth project assigned to us was the documentary remix project. This project asked me to do something I have never done before, film a short documentary. I was excited to start this, because it gave us a break from the long papers we were writing, and let us do something different, and use a video camera. Another fun thing about this project was that it was assigned in groups of four. My group consisted of myself and three other guys, but only one showed up to class and helped me with it. This didn’t annoy me too much, because I and my partner Aaron didn’t have much trouble putting the documentary together, and we actually had a good time while doing it. On the Monday this project was assigned, we watched a documentary and filled out a worksheet, introducing us to the structure and content of a documentary. I and my partner decided to make our documentary personal, and target the book stores on campus. Our objective was to show how textbook companies in East Lansing are charging too much for their books, and making too high of a profit off us poor college students. We had a few friends act in our documentaries, interviewed owners of local bookstores, and had a good time editing our documentary. It was nice to only have to write a 1-2 page paper about our documentary, instead of writing a 6 page paper on a different topic. I suggest you communicate with your partners early in the project, exchanging phone numbers and contact information, so everyone in the group is on board with the project, and the work can be divided up equally. I think I will receive a grade of a 3.5 or higher, because our documentary is well put together, met the length requirement, and has a good objective behind it.</p>
			<p>After I submit this final project, I will be done with my writing course WRA 110. The amount you learn from a writing class varies depending on how much work you put in. If you focus and take every paper seriously, listen to feedback from the professor, and push yourself as hard as you can to ace every paper, you will be satisfied and feel like you’ve learned a lot. From this course I learned how to take a strong standpoint on a social issue of culture. The greatest thing I learned in this class and that I will cherish, is that I learned the structure and how to film a documentary. I’ve always been extremely interested in them, and am glad I got to learn how. I am still disappointed I never wrote my formal research essay, because I could’ve learned a lot about research and writing papers using that research. My grade in this class will be decent, probably a 2.5, but it could have easily been a 3-3.5 if I submitted a research essay. This class immensely improves my skills as a writer, and I will take these skills I’ve learned and use them for the rest of my life in my profession. I am very satisfied with this course, from the first project to the final, and am glad I signed up for it.</p>
