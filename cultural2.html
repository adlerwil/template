			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the world we live in today, there is a certain group of men who live a lifestyle of partying and causing trouble, however, at the same time, these men are millionaires. These men should be setting an example for the youth of America, showing that hard work and dedication pays off, but instead are getting into scandals with the media, and piling up the arrests, which are very public and disturbing to the population. I am of course referring to the National Football League players. These professional athletes are the best at what they do, and worked very hard to achieve their title as an NFL player. Because of this, these men have set up careers for themselves to become multi-millionaires, for playing the sport they love every day.  Instead of being a good role model for young athletes across the country, they flaunt all their money they have and decide to use it to their own disadvantage. Since the 2013 super bowl, thirty one well known NFL players have been arrested, and charged with everything from a murder, DUIâ€™s, gambling, possession of illicit drugs, gun possession and even soliciting a prostitute. The list is endless, and in my eyes, these players are disgusting, and trashing their whole reputation in the NFL that they worked so hard to get.</p>
